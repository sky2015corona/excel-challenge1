Three conclusions from the data: Based on the Backers Outcome sheet the difference in the median and mean goal highlights having a higher goal is aligned with a greater chance of success. The Mode suggests the need for the project creator to set realistic goal. Smaller projects that have well structured scopes can also appeal to backers and achieve success as well.
States Limitaions of the datset and sugestions for additional tables of graph: The limitations would exteral factors such as market trends, competition, and unforseen events. Also, Project size and complexity can play a part in the success chances. Additional graph suggestions would be Geographical Analysis and Project type Anaylsis.
A brief and compelling justification of whether the mean or median better summarizes the data: Because the mode of successful and failed is 85 to 1, the data might not ne normalled distributed. Median would be better to sum up the information because it gives you a better sense on central goal values that most projects fall under while reducing the affect of extreme values.
